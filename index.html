            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Jack, a dedicated mathematics tutor and student. With strong academic credentials and 2 years of teaching experience, I specialize in helping students build confidence and achieve their goals. My patient, friendly approach ensures every student learns at their own pace while developing a solid understanding of mathematical principles.</p>

            <h2>Lessons</h2>
            <p>In my lessons, students experience a respectful, safe, and engaging learning environment designed to help them thrive. All classes are conducted through Google Classroom, where I utilize a shared virtual whiteboard to facilitate interactive learning and clear demonstration of concepts. While students are encouraged to use their video cameras to enhance engagement and communication, this is not mandatory – I understand and respect that some students may feel more comfortable with audio-only participation.</p>
            <p>Between my studies, I am occasionally contracting as a tutor for a company partnered with London schools, and I have previously worked within the energy sector in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai Emirate). I am also a keen long-distance runner, cyclist and hiker.</p>
