			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi there! I'm Jack. I am an 18-year-old accomplished scholar studying mathematics at undergraduate level at a university in London. I specialise in the fields of probability, randomness, and statistics. I have previously worked for energy companies in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai Emirate) between my studies. </p>

			<p>I've been a private tutor (paid and unpaid) on-and-off throughout my studies for the past three years, helping students at A-Level and below achieve the best grades they can.</p>

			<h2>Lessons & Specifics</h2>
			<p>I offer a trial lesson to begin with, which is free. I request all students syllabus before beginning lessons, or their past academic work, to give me a better idea of what they need to learn. My lessons are offered at the same rate (£25 p/hr), whether it is in person or virtually. I have a document camera that allows the student to view what I'm doing on paper. I do not request the student to turn on their camera.</p>

			<h2>Who Do I Teach?</h2>
			<p>SATS (years 5 & 6)</p>
			<p>GCSE (years 7-11)</p>
			<p>A-Level (years 12-13)</p>


			<h2>Prices</h2>
			<p>My lessons are reasonably priced at £25 an hour, whether its the evening, weekends or a bank holiday.</p>

			<h2>Contact Me</h2>
			<p>Please reach me at jackewingmaths@gmail.com, or +44 (0)7951 962015</p>
